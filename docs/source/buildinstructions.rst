Build Instructions
===================================

-----------------------------------
Build with CMake (recommended)
-----------------------------------

Dependency and environment variable settings
---------------------------------------------------

H5bench depends on MPI and Parallel HDF5.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use system provided by HDF5 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For instance on the Cori system at NERSC:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	module load cray-hdf5-parallel

You can also load any paralel HDF5 provided on your system, and you are good to go.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use your own installed HDF5
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Make sure to unload any system provided HDF5 version, and set an environment variable to specify the HDF5 install path:

.. code-block:: bash

	HDF5_HOME: the location you installed HDF5. It should point to a path that look like /path_to_my_hdf5_build/hdf5 and contains include/, lib/ and bin/ subdirectories.


Compile with CMake
---------------------------------------------------

Assume that the repo is cloned and now you are in the source directory h5bench, run the following simple steps:

.. code-block:: bash

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make


Build to run in async
---------------------------------------------------

To run h5bench_vpicio or h5bench_bdcatsio in async mode, you need the develop branchs of BOTH HDF5 and Async-VOL and build H5bench separately.

.. code-block:: bash

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DWITH_ASYNC_VOL:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-I/$YOUR_ASYNC_VOL/src -L/$YOUR_ASYNC_VOL/src"
	make

Necessary environment variable setting:

.. code-block:: bash

	export HDF5_HOME="$YOUR_HDF5_DEVELOP_BRANCH_BUILD/hdf5"
	export ASYNC_HOME="$YOUR_ASYNC_VOL/src"
	export HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR="async under_vol=0;under_info={}"
	export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH="$ASYNC_HOME"
	export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HDF5_HOME/lib:$ASYNC_HOME"


And all the binaries will be built to the build/directory.
