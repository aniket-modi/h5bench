# H5bench: a Parallel I/O Benchmark suite for HDF5
H5bench is a suite of parallel I/O benchmarks or kernels representing I/O patterns that are commonly used in HDF5 applications on high performance computing systems. H5bench measures I/O performance from various aspects, including the I/O overhead, observed I/O rate, etc.
  
# Instructions to build H5bench
## Build with CMake (**recommended**)
### Dependency and environment variable settings
H5bench depends on MPI and Parallel HDF5. 

#### Use system provided HDF5
For instance on the Cori system at NERSC:

- `module load cray-hdf5-parallel` 

or 

load any parallel HDF5 provided on your system, and you are good to go.

#### Use your own installed HDF5
Make sure to unload any system provided HDF5 version, and set an environment variable to specify the HDF5 install path:

- **HDF5_HOME**: the location you installed HDF5. It should point to a path that look like /path_to_my_hdf5_build/hdf5 and contains include/, lib/ and bin/ subdirectories. 

### Compile with CMake
Assume that the repo is cloned and now you are in the source directory h5bench, run the following simple steps:

- `mkdir build`

- `cd build`

- `cmake ..`

- `make`

And all the binaries will be built to the build / directory.

## Build with Spack (experimental)
Assuming you have installed Spack, and it will try to find and install dependencies for you.

- Create a spack package:
    - `spack create --force https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/h5bench/downloads/h5bench-0.1.tar`

- Then you will be put in an opend python document (for details see here https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_packaging.html) and you only need to add 2 dependencies:
    - `depends_on(mpi)`
    - `depends_on(hdf5)`

- And you are good to install:
    - `spack install h5bench`

- Binaries will be added to your $PATH environment variable after you load them by
    - `spack load h5bench`

And now you can call the benchmark apps in your scripts directly. 
  
# Benchmark suite usage
## Basic I/O benchmark
## Major refactoring is in progress, this document may be out of date. Both h5bench_vpicio and h5bench_bdcats take config and data file path as command line arguments.
This set of benchmarks contains an I/O kernel developed based on a particle physics simulation's I/O pattern (VPIC-IO for writing data in a HDF5 file) and on a big data clustering algorithm (BDCATS-IO for reading the HDF5 file VPIC-IO wrote).

- Optional CSV file output: Performance results will be print to standard output, an optional CSV output is available, simply add `CSV my_csv_file_path` to the end of your h5bench_vpicio/h5bench_bdcatsio command line.
    - - Example: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_vpicio sample_1d.cfg data_1d.h5 CSV perf_1d.csv` 
- Optional metadata capture: **Use this only when you select to use the above CSV option**: If you want to collect running metadata, add `META metadata_list_file` after the two CSV arguments. The metadata_list_file contains a list of envaronment variable names that you want to capture, such as LSB_JOBID for the systems that run LSB scheduler, or SLURM_JOB_ID for Slurm.
    - Example: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_vpicio sample_1d.cfg data_1d.h5 CSV perf_1d.csv META sample_metadata_list` 
## Basic write benchmark - h5bench_vpicio

**To set parameters for the h5bench_vpicio:**

The h5bench_vpicio takes all parameters in a plain text config file. The content format is strict.
Take `basic_io/sample_config/sample_cc2d.cfg` as an example, it looks like below, and we will discus them one by one:
```
# this is a comment
# Benchmark mode can only be one of these: CC/CI/IC/II/CC2D/CI2D/IC2D/II2D/CC2D/CC3D
PATTERN=CC2D
DATA_COLL=NO # Optional, specify to use independent or collective data operations, if not set, it will be treated as NO.
META_COLL=NO # Optional, specify to use independent or collective metadata, NO for default.
PARTICLE_CNT_M=8
TIME_STEPS_CNT=1
SLEEP_TIME=1
DIM_1=4096
DIM_2=2048
DIM_3=64 # extra dimension take no effects.
FILE_PER_PROC=NO #Optional, default is NO.
```
- To enable parallel compression feature for VPIC, add following section to the config file, and make sure chunk dimension settings are compatible with the data dimensions: they must have the same rank of dimensions (eg,. 2D array dataset needs 2D chunk dimensions), and chunk dimension size cannot be greater than data dimension size. **Note:** There is a know bug on HDF5 parallel compression that could cause the system run out of memory when the chunk amount is large (large number of particle and very small chunk sizes). On Cori Hasswell nodes, the setting of 16M particles per rank, 8 nodes (total 256 ranks), 64 * 64 chunk size will crash the system by runing out of memory, on single nodes the minimal chunk size is 4 * 4.  
```
COMPRESS=YES # to enable parallel compression(chunking)
CHUNK_DIM_1=512 # chunk dimensions
CHUNK_DIM_2=256
CHUNK_DIM_3=1 # extra chunk dimension take no effects.
```

- For 2D/3D benchmarks (such as CI2D or CC3D), make sure the dimensions are set correctly and matches the per rank particle number. For example, when your PATTERN is CC3D, and PARTICLE_CNT_M is 1, means 1M particles per rank, setting DIM_1~3 to 64, 64, and 256 is valid, because 64 * 64 * 256 = 1,048,576 (1M); and 10 * 20 * 30 is an invalid setting.
- For 1D benchmarks (CC/CI/IC/II), DIM_1 must be set to the total particle number, and the rest two dimensions must be set to 1.
- FILE_PER_PROC enables file-per-process mode. This mode does not utilize mpio for I/O.

- No blank line and blank space are allowed.


#### Parameter PATTERN: the write pattern
The I/O patterns include array of structures (AOS) and structure of arrays (SOA) in memory as well as in file. The array dimensions are 1D, 2D, and 3D for the write benchmark.

This defines the write access pattern, including CC/CI/IC/II/CC2D/CI2D/IC2D/II2D/CC2D/CC3D where C strands for “contiguous” and I stands for “interleaved” for the source (the data layout in the memory) and the destination (the data layout in the resulting file). For example, CI2D is a write pattern where the in-memory data layout is contiguous (see the implementation of prepare_data_contig_2D() for details) and file data layout is interleaved by due to its’ compound data structure (see the implementation of data_write_contig_to_interleaved () for details).
  
#### Parameter PARTICLE_CNT_M: the number of particles that each rank needs to process, in M (1024*1024)
This number and the three dimension parameters (DIM_1, DIM_2, and DIM_3) must be set such that the formula holds: PARTICLE_CNT_M * (1024 * 1024) == DIM_1 * DIM_2 * DIM_3
  
#### Parameters TIME_STEPS_CNT and SLEEP_TIME: the number of iterations
In each iteration, the same amount of data will be written and the file size will increase correspondingly. After each iteration, the program sleeps for $SLEEP_TIME seconds to emulate the application computation.

#### Parameters DATA_COLL and META_COLL: optional lines for collective operations.
These are optional, set to "YES" to collective operations on data and metadata respectively, otherwise and default (not set) cases independent.

#### Parameters DIM_1, DIM_2, and DIM_3: the dimensionality of the source data
Always set these parameters in ascending order, and set unused dimensions to 1, and remember that PARTICLE_CNT_M * (1024 * 1024) == DIM_1 * DIM_2 * DIM_3 must hold. For example, DIM_1=1024, DIM_2=256, DIM_3=1 is a valid setting for a 2D array.

**To run the vpicio_h5bench:**

- Single process test:
    - `./h5bench_vpicio your_config_file output_file`

- Parallel run (replace mpirun with your system provided command, for example, srun on Cori/NERSC and jsrun on Summit/OLCF):
    - `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_vpicio your_config_file output_file`
    - `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_vpicio sample_1d.cfg data_1d.h5 CSV perf_1d.csv META sample_metadata_list` will also generate a CSV file that contains performance data and job metadata.
        - A sample metadata list file for systems runing Slurm can be found in metalist_cori.txt, looks like below, just list your interested environment variables. Note: lines started with # will be ignored, and blank spaces (tabs, white spaces) are not allowed in the lines.
        ```
        SLURM_PROCID
        SLURM_JOB_GID
        SLURM_CPU_BIND
        SLURMD_NODENAME
        ```

## Basic read benchmark - h5bench_bdcatsio

BDCATSIO takes an h5 file generated by VPICIO as an input, and performs a series of parallel read operations. 
**NOTE:** BDCATSIO only accepts files that are created in one of the three CC (contig-contig) modes: CC, CC2D and CC3D, and the dimensionality must match too.

The parameters should be organized in a config file and given from the command line:
`./h5bench_bdcatsio $config_file $data_file_path`

The definitions of **time_steps** and **sleep_time** are same as those for h5bench_vpicio.
Following read patterns are supported: Contiguous reading on 1D/2D/3D, Partial reading on 1D, Strided reading on 1D.
Parameter $pattern can only be one of 5 below. The examples used below assume the file has 8M particles in total, and we use 2 MPI processes.

-   **SEQ**: contiguously read through the whole 1D data file.
    - Followed by $cnt_element_to_read per rank in 1024 * 1024.
    - Command format: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio my_file $cnt_time_steps $sleep_time SEQ $M_particles_to_read`
    - Example run: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio data_1d.h5 1 1 SEQ 8` 

-   **PART**: contiguously read the first K elements.
    - Followed by $cnt_element_to_read.
    - Command format: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio my_file $cnt_time_steps $sleep_time PART $M_elements_to_read`
    - Example run: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio data_1d.h5 1 1 PART 1`

-   **STRIDED**: strided reading.   **NOTE**: Strided reading only supported on 1D data.
    - Followed by $cnt_element_to_read $stride_length $block_size
    - Command format: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio my_file $cnt_time_steps $sleep_time  STRIDED  $M_elements_to_read $stride_length $block_size` 
    - Example run: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio data_1d.h5 1 1 STRIDED 1 64 16` reads top 16 elements every 64 elements.

-   **2D**: contiguously read through the whole 2D data file.
    - Followed by $cnt_element_to_read $dim_1 $dim_2
    - Command format: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio my_file $cnt_time_steps $sleep_time 2D $dim_1 $dim_2` 
    - Example run: ` mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio data_2d.h5 1 1 2D 1024 2048` reads a 2D array with dimensionality of 1024 * 2048, dimensioanl values must no greater than that of the data file, in this case 4096 * 2048 (sample_cc2d.cfg).

-   **3D**: contiguously read through the whole 3D data file.
    - Followed by $dim_1 $dim_2 $dim_3
    - Command format: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio my_file $cnt_time_steps $sleep_time 3D $dim_1 $dim_2 $dim_3` 
    - Example: `mpirun -n 2 ./h5bench_bdcatsio data_3d.h5 1 1 3D 512 256 32` reads a 3D array of elements with dimensionality of 512 * 256 * 32, dimensioanl values must no greater than that of the data file, in this case 1024 * 2048 * 64 (sample_cc3d.cfg).


## Example combination runs of h5bench_vpicio and h5bench_bdcatsio 
### 1D array data
- 1D array write: the file is generated with with 4 ranks, each rank write 8M elements. The file should be around 1GB.
    - `mpirun -n 4 ./h5bench_vpicio ../basic_io/sample_config/sample_cc1d.cfg 1d_4ranks_8M.h5`

Config file:    
```
# sample_cc1d.cfg 
PATTERN=CC
PARTICLE_CNT_M=8
TIME_STEPS_CNT=1
SLEEP_TIME=1
DIM_1=8388608
```
Some valid bdcats runs:

- Read all 8M elements on each rank
    - `mpirun -n 4 ./h5bench_bdcatsio 1d_4ranks_8M.h5 1 1 SEQ 8`

- Read top 1M elements on each rank
    - `mpirun -n 4 ./h5bench_bdcatsio 1d_4ranks_8M.h5 1 1 PART 1`

- On each rank, reads top 16 elements every 64 elements.
    - `mpirun -n 4 ./h5bench_bdcatsio 1d_4ranks_8M.h5 1 1 STRIDED 1 64 16`  

### Multi-dimensional array data 
- Using 2D as the example, 3D cases are similar, the file is generated with with 4 ranks, each rank write 8M elements, organized in a 4096 * 2048 array, in total it forms a (4 * 4096) * 2048 2D array. The file should be around 1GB.
    - `mpirun -n 4 ./h5bench_vpicio ../basic_io/sample_config/sample_cc2d.cfg 2d_4ranks_8M.h5`
    
Config file:
```
PATTERN=CC2D
PARTICLE_CNT_M=8
TIME_STEPS_CNT=1
SLEEP_TIME=1
DIM_1=4096
DIM_2=2048
DIM_3=64 # extra dimension take no effects.
```
- Read with 4 ranks, each rank reads an 4096 * 2048 array, so they read out all the elements from the file.
    - `mpirun -n 4 ./h5bench_bdcatsio 2d_4ranks_8M.h5 1 1 2D 4096 2048`

## h5bench_exerciser
We modified this benchmark slightly so to be able to specify a file location that is writable. Except for the first argument $write_file_prefix, it's identical to the original one. Original README can be found here https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/ExaHDF5/BuildAndTest/-/blob/master/Exerciser/README.md

Example run:

   - `mpirun -n 8 ./h5bench_exerciser $write_file_prefix -numdims 2 --minels 8 8 --nsizes 3 --bufmult 2 --dimranks 8 4`


## The metadata stress test: h5bench_hdf5_iotest
This is the same benchmark as it's originally found at https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5-iotest. We modified this benchmark slightly so to be able to specify the config file location, everything else remains untouched.

Example run:

   - `mpirun -n 4 ./h5bench_hdf5_iotest hdf5_iotest.ini`


## Streaming operation benchmark: h5bench_vl_stream_hl
This benchmark tests the performance of append operation. It supports two types of appends, FIXED and VLEN, represents fixed length data and variable length data respectively.
Note: This benchmark doesn't run in parallel mode.
#### To run the benchmark

`./h5bench_vl_stream_hl write_file_path FIXED/VLEN num_ops`

Example runs:

    - ` ./h5bench_vl_stream_hl here.dat FIXED 1000`
    - ` ./h5bench_vl_stream_hl here.dat VLEN 1000`
